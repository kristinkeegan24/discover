        <h2>Puffins in Howth</h2>
        <p>This is the only place in Co. Dublin where we can see these birds.</p>

		<h2>Puffins</h2>
		
		<p class="text-center">
			Puffins are small, seabirds known for their colorful beaks, striking black-and-white plumage, and charming, clown-like appearance. Found primarily in the North Atlantic, these birds spend most of their lives at sea, only coming ashore during breeding season to nest in burrows along rocky cliffs. Their diet consists mainly of fish, which they catch with their specialized beaks that can hold multiple fish at once. Despite their adorable looks, puffins are strong fliers and excellent swimmers, using their wings to &quot;fly&quot; underwater while hunting. Unfortunately, puffin populations are threatened by climate change, overfishing, and habitat loss, making conservation efforts crucial for their survival. Thankfully, there are still many on Howth island that people are welcome to see on small boat visits around the island!
			
		<br>
		<br>
			Puffins are a notable presence on Ireland's Eye, a small island just north of Howth in County Dublin. During the summer months, these seabirds establish breeding colonies on the island's cliffs and grassy slopes. Visitors can observe puffins by taking boat tours around Ireland's Eye, offering an opportunity to see these birds in their natural habitat without causing disturbance. It's important to maintain a respectful distance to ensure the puffins are not disrupted, as they are sensitive during their breeding season.

		Vico Baths
		</h2>

		<p>
		The Vico Baths, located along Vico Road in Dalkey, South County Dublin, are a historic sea swimming spot dating back to at least the 19th century. Originally a gentlemen-only bathing place, they have since become a cherished destination for all sea-swimming enthusiasts. Accessed through a discreet gap in the wall on Vico Road, visitors descend a series of steps leading to the baths, which offer panoramic views of the surrounding coastline. Notably, the site features a large &quot;7 EIRE&quot; sign, a remnant from World War II, designed to aid aerial navigation and indicate Ireland's neutrality.
<br>
			<br>

In recent years, the Vico Baths have garnered attention due to visits from celebrities such as Harry Styles and Matt Damon, enhancing their appeal. Despite their growing popularity, the baths retain a serene atmosphere, especially during sunrise, making them a favored spot for both locals and visitors. While the waters can be brisk, the invigorating experience, coupled with the stunning scenery, continues to attract swimmers seeking a unique and refreshing dip.
